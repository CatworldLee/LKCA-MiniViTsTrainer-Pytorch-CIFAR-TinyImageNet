## What You Can Do with This Repository

### 1. Official Repository of LKCA :books:

As the official repository for LKCA, we offer a suite of tools and libraries to support the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence projects. Whether you're looking for the latest research findings or reliable code implementations, this is your go-to starting point.

### 2. Train Various ViTs on Small Datasets with Just a GPU or CPU ðŸ’»

This repository emphasizes machine learning practices in resource-constrained environments, specifically training various Vision Transformers (ViTs) on small datasets. We understand that not everyone has access to large-scale computational resources, so we provide optimized algorithms and practical advice for effective training with just a single GPU or CPU. Our goal is to lower the entry barrier, enabling more people to innovate and research with the latest technologies.
